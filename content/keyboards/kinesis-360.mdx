## Overview

The Kinesis Advantage 360 Pro is ratataque's full-size ergonomic keyboard. Unlike the Corne and TOTEM which are flat split boards, the Kinesis uses concave key wells that match the natural curl of fingers.

## Key Features

- **Concave key wells**: Keys are arranged in a bowl shape matching finger curl
- **Full key count**: Has number row, function keys, and dedicated modifier keys
- **ZMK firmware**: The Pro model runs ZMK, allowing full customization
- **Bluetooth**: Built-in wireless support
- **Thumb clusters**: Large thumb clusters for modifiers and navigation

## ZMK Configuration

```c
// Kinesis 360 Pro keymap (simplified)
/ {
    keymap {
        compatible = "zmk,keymap";
        default_layer {
            bindings = <
                &kp EQUAL &kp N1 &kp N2 &kp N3 &kp N4 &kp N5
                &kp N6 &kp N7 &kp N8 &kp N9 &kp N0 &kp MINUS
                &kp TAB &kp Q &kp W &kp E &kp R &kp T
                &kp Y &kp U &kp I &kp O &kp P &kp BSLH
                // ... additional rows
            >;
        };
    };
};
```

## Compared to Flat Splits

| Feature | Kinesis 360 | Corne/TOTEM |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Form factor | Concave wells | Flat PCB |
| Key count | ~76 | 38-42 |
| Portability | Desk-bound | Highly portable |
| Layer dependency | Low | High |
| Learning curve | Moderate | Steep |
| Price | Premium | Budget-friendly |

## Use Case

The Kinesis serves as the desk-bound daily driver when portability isn't needed. The concave wells are comfortable for long coding sessions, and the full key count means less layer switching than the Corne or TOTEM.
