## Overview

The Corne (CRKBD) is the primary keyboard for both ratataque and GrimalDev. It's a 42-key split columnar stagger board running ZMK firmware. The minimal key count forces efficient use of layers.

## Why Corne?

- **42 keys** forces intentional layer design
- **Columnar stagger** reduces finger travel
- **Split** allows natural shoulder width
- **Thumb clusters** replace pinky-heavy modifiers
- **Portable** -- easy to carry between setups

## ratataque's Layout

Three layers: QWERTY base, symbols, and navigation. The firmware also includes a Colemak layer for experimentation.

Key features:
- Home row mods (disabled currently in favor of dedicated modifier keys)
- Symbol layer on left thumb hold
- Nav layer on right thumb hold
- Numbers on the top row of nav layer
- French accent layer (é, è, ê, à, ù, ç)
- Custom Rust firmware for additional features
- Slightly different thumb cluster assignments

## Firmware

Both contributors use ZMK firmware built via GitHub Actions. Push to the zmk-config repo triggers a build that produces a `.uf2` file ready to flash.

```yaml
# ZMK build matrix (west.yml)
include:
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: corne_left
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: corne_right
```

## Build

The physical keyboard uses:
- **MCU**: nice!nano v2 (nRF52840)
- **Switches**: Varies (both use tactile)
- **Keycaps**: MT3 or DSA profile
- **Case**: 3D printed or FR4 plate
