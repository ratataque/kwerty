## Overview

GlazeWM brings tiling window management to Windows, filling the gap for users who work across Linux, macOS, and Windows. The YAML config mirrors the Hyprland/yabai keybinding philosophy.

## Configuration

```yaml
# GlazeWM config.yaml
general:
  focus_follows_cursor: true
  cursor_follows_focus: true

gaps:
  inner_gap: "8px"
  outer_gap:
    top: "8px"
    right: "8px"
    bottom: "8px"
    left: "8px"

bar:
  enabled: false  # Using Zebar instead

keybindings:
  # Focus
  - commands: ["focus --direction left"]
    bindings: ["alt+h"]
  - commands: ["focus --direction down"]
    bindings: ["alt+j"]
  - commands: ["focus --direction up"]

  - commands: ["move --direction left"]
    bindings: ["alt+shift+h"]

    bindings: ["alt+1"]

## Paired with Zebar

GlazeWM's built-in bar is disabled in favor of Zebar (see Zebar config) for a more customizable status bar with Catppuccin theming.
