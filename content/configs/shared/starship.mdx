## Overview

Starship provides a fast, customizable prompt that works across shells. GrimalDev's config uses Everforest colors with right-aligned git info and time. ratataque uses Catppuccin-based colors.

## GrimalDev's Configuration

### Format

```toml
format = """
$os\
$username\
$hostname\
$directory\
$nodejs\
$rust\
$python\
$lua\
$golang\
$java\
$kotlin\
$docker_context\
$fill\
$git_branch\
$git_state\
$git_status\
$time\
$line_break\
$character"""
```

### Prompt Character

```toml
[character]
success_symbol = "[](bold fg:green)"
error_symbol = "[](bold fg:red)"
```

### OS Detection

```toml
[os]
disabled = false

[os.symbols]
Macos = " "
Linux = " "
Windows = " "
```

### Username & Hostname

```toml
[username]
show_always = true
format = "[$user]($style) "

[hostname]
ssh_only = false
format = "on [$hostname]($style) "
disabled = true
```

### Directory

```toml
[directory]
style = "bold fg:orange"
truncation_length = 3
truncation_symbol = "…/"
```

### Fill (Right-Alignment)

```toml
[fill]
symbol = " "
```

### Git

```toml
[git_branch]
symbol = " "
style = "bold fg:green"

[git_state]
format = '[\($state( $progress_current of $progress_total)\)]($style) '

[git_status]
style = "bold red"
format = '([\[$all_status$ahead_behind\]]($style) )'
conflicted = "="
ahead = "⇡${count}"
behind = "⇣${count}"
diverged = "⇕⇡${ahead_count}⇣${behind_count}"
untracked = "?"
stashed = "$"
modified = "!"
staged = "+"
renamed = "»"
deleted = "✘"
```

### Time

```toml
[time]
disabled = false
format = '[$time]($style)'
time_format = "%H:%M"
style = "fg:#d3c6aa"
```

### Language Modules

```toml
[nodejs]
symbol = " "
style = "fg:#d3c6aa"

[rust]
symbol = " "
style = "bold fg:orange"

[python]
symbol = " "
style = "bold fg:green"

[lua]
symbol = " "
style = "fg:#d3c6aa"

[golang]
symbol = " "
style = "fg:#d3c6aa"

[java]
symbol = " "
style = "fg:#d3c6aa"

[kotlin]
symbol = " "
style = "fg:#d3c6aa"

[docker_context]
symbol = " "
style = "fg:#d3c6aa"
```

### Everforest Palette

```toml
[palettes.everforest]
black = "#1e2326"
red = "#e67e80"
orange = "#e69875"
yellow = "#dbbc7f"
green = "#a7c080"
aqua = "#83c092"
blue = "#7fbbb3"
purple = "#d699b6"
fg = "#d3c6aa"
bg = "#2b3339"
grey = "#7a8478"
```

## Performance

Starship is written in Rust and renders in under 10ms. The prompt is non-blocking -- if a module takes too long, it's skipped with a configurable timeout:

```toml
command_timeout = 500
scan_timeout = 30
```
