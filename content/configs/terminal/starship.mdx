## Overview

Starship provides a fast, customizable prompt that works across shells. Configured with Catppuccin colors and powerline-style segments showing git status, language versions, and directory context.

## Configuration

```toml
# starship.toml
format = """
$directory\
$git_branch\
$git_status\
$nodejs\
$rust\
$python\
$lua\
$golang\
$line_break\
$character"""

[character]
success_symbol = "[❯](bold green)"
error_symbol = "[❯](bold red)"

[directory]
style = "bold blue"
truncation_length = 3
truncation_symbol = "…/"
```

## Git Integration

```toml
[git_branch]
symbol = " "
style = "bold mauve"

[git_status]
style = "bold red"
format = '([\[$all_status$ahead_behind\]]($style) )'
conflicted = "="
ahead = "⇡${count}"
behind = "⇣${count}"
diverged = "⇕⇡${ahead_count}⇣${behind_count}"
untracked = "?"
stashed = "$"
modified = "!"
staged = "+"
renamed = "»"
deleted = "✘"
```

## Language Modules

```toml
[nodejs]
symbol = " "
style = "bold green"

[rust]
symbol = " "
style = "bold peach"

[python]
symbol = " "
style = "bold yellow"

[lua]
symbol = " "
style = "bold blue"

[golang]
symbol = " "
style = "bold cyan"
```

## Performance

Starship is written in Rust and renders in under 10ms. The prompt is non-blocking -- if a module takes too long, it's skipped with a configurable timeout:

```toml
command_timeout = 500
scan_timeout = 30
```
