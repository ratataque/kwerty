## Overview

ratataque's primary platform is Arch Linux with Hyprland as the Wayland compositor. The entire desktop is keyboard-driven with no mouse needed for daily development work.

## Stack

| Layer | Tool |
|-------|------|
| OS | Arch Linux (rolling release) |
| Display server | Wayland |
| Compositor/WM | Hyprland |
| Status bar | quickshell / waybar |
| Terminal | Kitty |
| Shell | Fish + Starship |
| Multiplexer | tmux |
| Editor | Neovim |
| Launcher | rofi |
| File manager | yazi |
| Key remapping | xremap |
| Git | lazygit |

## Installation

Arch is installed via `archinstall` with minimal packages, then configured via the `.dotfiles` repo using GNU Stow for symlink management:

```bash
# Clone dotfiles
git clone https://github.com/ratataque/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles

# Symlink all configs
cd ~/.dotfiles
stow fish kitty tmux hypr nvim lazygit rofi yazi starship xremap
```

## Key Remapping Chain

1. **Keyboard firmware (ZMK)**: Hardware-level key positions and layers
2. **xremap**: System-level CapsLock → Esc/Ctrl, Ctrl+HJKL → arrows
3. **Hyprland**: Window management keybindings (SUPER+...)
4. **tmux**: Session/pane navigation (prefix + ...)
5. **Neovim**: Editor keybindings (leader + ...)

Each layer handles its own domain without conflicts.
