## Overview

GrimalDev's macOS workflow achieves near-parity with ratataque's Linux setup using yabai for tiling, skhd for keybindings, and karabiner for key remapping. The same muscle memory works across both platforms.

## Stack

| Layer | Tool |
|-------|------|
| OS | macOS |
| WM | yabai |
| Hotkeys | skhd |
| Key remapping | Karabiner-Elements |
| Status bar | sketchybar |
| Terminal | Kitty |
| Shell | Fish + Starship |
| Multiplexer | tmux |
| Editor | Neovim (NvChad) |
| File manager | ranger |
| Git | lazygit |

## Setup

```bash
# Install Homebrew packages
brew install yabai skhd karabiner-elements kitty fish tmux neovim lazygit

# Start services
yabai --start-service
skhd --start-service

# Clone dotfiles
git clone https://github.com/GrimalDev/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
```

## macOS-Specific Considerations

- **SIP**: System Integrity Protection must be partially disabled for yabai's space features
- **Accessibility**: yabai and skhd need accessibility permissions
- **Karabiner**: Runs as a kernel extension for low-level key remapping
- **sketchybar**: Custom font for app icons (see sketchybar-app-font repo)

## Cross-Platform Alignment

The keybinding scheme is designed to match ratataque's Linux setup:

| Action | Linux (Hyprland) | macOS (yabai/skhd) |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Focus left | `SUPER+H` | `ALT+H` |
| Move window | `SUPER+SHIFT+H` | `ALT+SHIFT+H` |
| Workspace 1 | `SUPER+1` | `ALT+1` |
| Launch terminal | `SUPER+Return` | `ALT+Return` |
| App launcher | `SUPER+D` (rofi) | `ALT+Space` (spotlight) |
