## Overview

Windows is the third platform supported by both contributors. GlazeWM provides tiling window management, Zebar adds a status bar, and Arch WSL provides the full Linux terminal stack inside Windows.

## Stack

| Layer | Tool |
|-------|------|
| OS | Windows 11 |
| WM | GlazeWM |
| Status bar | Zebar |
| Terminal | Windows Terminal / Kitty |
| WSL | Arch Linux (WSL2) |
| Shell (WSL) | Fish + Starship |
| Multiplexer | tmux (inside WSL) |
| Editor | Neovim (inside WSL) |

## GlazeWM + Zebar

GlazeWM handles window tiling with the same `ALT+HJKL` bindings used on macOS. Zebar provides the top status bar with Catppuccin theming.

See the GlazeWM and Zebar config pages for details.

## Arch WSL

Development happens inside Arch WSL, which provides the identical terminal stack:

```powershell
# Install Arch WSL
wsl --install -d Arch

# Inside WSL, install the full stack
sudo pacman -S fish neovim tmux lazygit yazi starship
```

Once inside WSL, the Fish/tmux/Neovim environment is identical to ratataque's native Arch setup. The dotfiles repo works unchanged.

## Workflow

1. **GlazeWM** manages Windows application windows
2. **Windows Terminal** runs WSL instances
3. **tmux** inside WSL manages terminal sessions
4. **Neovim** inside tmux for editing
5. All keyboard shortcuts maintain cross-platform consistency

## Limitations

- No xremap equivalent (Windows key remapping is more limited)
- WSL filesystem performance is slower than native Linux
- Some Hyprland-specific features (blur, animations) not available
